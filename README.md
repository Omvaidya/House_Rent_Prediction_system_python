# Housing Rent Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict housing rent prices using data from a CSV file. 
The analysis includes a variety of graphs and charts to visualize the data and the prediction results. 
The project is implemented in Python and can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the CSV file with housing data.
- **notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for the project.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Required Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the CSV file is present in this directory.

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-rent-prediction.git
cd housing-rent-prediction
```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   - **Using Jupyter Notebook:**

     Open the `Housing_Rent_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

   - **Using Google Colab:**

     Upload the `Housing_Rent_Prediction.ipynb` file to Google Colab.

3. **Execute the Code:**

   Run each code cell in the notebook. The output will be displayed after each cell, including tables, graphs, and charts.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**

   - Load the CSV file and explore the data.
   - Display summary statistics and data types.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Visualize data distributions.
   - Explore relationships between features and the target variable.

4. **Model Building:**

   - Train a machine learning model to predict housing rent.
   - Evaluate model performance.

5. **Results Visualization:**

   - Display prediction results.
   - Visualize model performance using graphs and charts.

## Results

The project provides insights into the factors affecting housing rent prices and demonstrates the use of machine learning models for prediction. The results are presented through various visualizations, making it easy to understand the analysis and the prediction performance.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the use of Python for data analysis and machine learning in predicting housing rent prices. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can replicate the analysis and gain insights into the housing market.
